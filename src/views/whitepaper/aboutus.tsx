                            passion for P2E/R2E, especially for building an
                            improved R2E that we feel is a gap in the Solana

                            with the introduction of the NFT marketplace in
                            2020. This was just the beginning of the NFT market
                            on Solana for me actually, a plethora of
                            possibilities! Here, I bought my very first NFT and
                            invested in Solana Monkey Business at 4 Sol (at that
                            time 1sol = $70.) Since that day, I never left the
                            NFT market.

                            DeGods, SolStead... who remembers solamanders? Or
                            the bears? Good old times... I was never really
                            active on Social Media or DAO but I have always been
                            looking around. I have seen the good, the bad and
                            the ugly in this space along with some funny stories
                            but I can't speak about all of them here!

                            expanding in Solana. My attention to other

                            been quite disappointing for me such as Cops Game
                            and I am currently seeing how Neon game is doing
